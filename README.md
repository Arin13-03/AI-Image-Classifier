# AI-Image-Classifier
We have built an AI-Image classifier app .This app successfully classifies images as Real or AI-generated fake image. The app also shows the p-scores of the classification with respect to it being real. This feature not only retains the transparency of the result but also carries important information. Images with borderline p-scores around 0.5 signifies that the image maybe a blend. 

For example tests against real images edited using AI-features resulted in p-values in range 0.6-0.8 approximately which says that it is primarily real but has some synthetic features to it in contrast to purely real phtotgraphs where p-score is usually above 0.95.
